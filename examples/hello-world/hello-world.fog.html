<ins>Hello, World!</ins>

<pre><comment>
This <pre>-block is interpreted as a rich-string literal and since it is unused it is compiled out
Pre-blocks allow for strings that use other non-<pre> html tags, like <comment> which is used for verbosity
<u>Hello, World!</u> also works in fog, but <u> isnt supported in github flavored markdown
</comment></pre>
